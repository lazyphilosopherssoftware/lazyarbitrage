To investigate arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency, focus on strategies like cross-exchange arbitrage (exploiting price differences across platforms) or triangular arbitrage (within a single exchange using three pairs). In 2025, opportunities typically yield 0.1-2% spreads due to market efficiency, but volatility in major assets can create fleeting gaps. Start small with high-liquidity setups to minimize risks like fees, withdrawal delays, and slippage. Below, I'll recommend exchanges and pairs based on liquidity, fees, reliability, and recent reports—prioritizing beginner-friendly options.

### Recommended Exchanges to Start With
Prioritize centralized exchanges (CEXs) with strong API support (e.g., for bots via CCXT) and global availability. These often show price discrepancies due to regional liquidity differences or user bases. Start with 2-3 exchanges to monitor via tools like arbitrage scanners or bots (e.g., ArbitrageScanner, Pionex, or 3Commas). Top picks for 2025:

- **Binance**: The go-to for arbitrage due to massive liquidity, low fees (0.1% spot trading), and support for 500+ pairs. It's ideal for cross-exchange plays, but note regional restrictions (e.g., no U.S. users; use Binance.US instead). Pair it with others for spreads like $200-300 per BTC during volatility.
- **Kraken**: Reliable for fiat-crypto gateways, with strong security and lower withdrawal fees. Great for U.S./EU users; often shows discrepancies with Asian exchanges like Binance. Fees: 0.16-0.26%.
- **Coinbase (or Coinbase Advanced Trade)**: Beginner-friendly with high trust, but higher fees (0.5%). Useful for arbitrage against Binance or OKX due to its U.S.-focused liquidity. Good for fiat pairs.
- **OKX or Bybit**: High-volume alternatives to Binance, with low fees (0.1%) and derivatives support. OKX is strong for altcoins; Bybit for perpetual futures arbitrage. Ideal for Asian/European users.
- **Others to Consider Later**: KuCoin, Huobi, Gate.io, or Bitfinex for more exotic pairs; Uniswap (DEX) for DeFi/cross-chain opportunities if you're advanced.

Start by comparing Binance vs. Kraken or Coinbase, as they often have noticeable spreads during market events.

### Recommended Pairs to Investigate First
Focus on highly liquid pairs to reduce slippage and ensure fast execution. Major stablecoin-based ones are safest for beginners, as they minimize volatility risk. Use scanners to monitor real-time differences. Top starters:

- **BTC/USDT**: The most common for cross-exchange arbitrage—high volume means frequent small spreads (0.1-1%). E.g., buy on Binance, sell on Kraken.
- **ETH/USDT**: Similar to BTC, with good liquidity for triangular setups (e.g., ETH/USDT -> BTC/ETH -> BTC/USDT on Binance).
- **BTC/ETH**: For triangular arbitrage within one exchange; discrepancies arise from order book depth.
- **USDT/USDC**: Stablecoin pairs for low-risk "funding" arbitrage; minor peg differences can yield profits with large volumes.
- **Altcoins like LTC/USDT or BCH/USDT**: Higher volatility = bigger spreads, but riskier; start here after majors.

### Tips for Getting Started
- **Tools**: Use free scanners like CoinMarketCap for price comparisons or bots like Pionex (integrated exchange) or Bitsgap (30+ exchanges) to automate detection. For coding your own (as in your prototype), monitor these via CCXT.
- **Factors to Watch**: Account for trading/withdrawal fees (can erase 0.1% spreads), transfer times (use fast chains like Solana for cross-chain), and API rate limits.
- **Risks**: Opportunities close in seconds; high competition from bots means you need speed. Start with paper trading.
- **Next Steps**: Check real-time prices on CoinMarketCap or use a bot demo. If scaling, explore cross-chain (e.g., Ethereum vs. Solana bridges).
